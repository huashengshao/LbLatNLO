Light-by-light scattering at next-to-leading order in QCD and QED

The code will calculate the (differential) cross section and generate unweighted events of light-by-light scattering process at high-energy colliders.

In addition to this repository, further documentation is available in
[arXiv:25XX.YYYYY](https://arxiv.org/abs/25XX.YYYYY). Please cite this
article, [arXiv:2312.16966](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16966) and [arXiv:2312.16956](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16956), as well as relevant references therein, if you use `LbLatNLO`.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Platform requirements

* `Linux` or `MacOS`.
* `bash`

Compiler requirements

* `gfortran` and `gcc`.

### Download and Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/huashengshao/LbLatNLO.git
cd LbLatNLO
./config
```

## Run

* Edit `input/run.inp`
* Run the code via
```
./LbLatNLO
```

## Output

* Screen printout
* Files in the `output/` subdirectory (The output files are generated by `analysis/user/plot_LbL.f90`. If you modify this file, you need to recompile the `LbLatNLO` code for your changes to take effect.)

## Example

If you use the default `input/run.inp` and run the code, it will calculate the NLO QCD and NLO QED cross section for light-by-light scattering in ultraperipheral proton-proton collisions (with the ChFF photon flux from [gamma-UPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03012)) at 14 TeV. The cross section is
